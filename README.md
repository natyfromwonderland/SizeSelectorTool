The code combines the Javascript code and html wrapping in the same file because it was embedded in the Google site. This allowed sharing within the company without creating a separate host server and is successfully used by colleagues in multiple countries.

The tool allows to select sizes from a catalogue of items by inserting your measurements. It works in both cm and inch.
